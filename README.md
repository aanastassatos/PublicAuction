# PublicAuction

## General Instructions
Run individual jars in the order Bank -> AuctionCentral -> AuctionHouse -> Agent, following the on screen prompts to enter IP addresses.
Once all are running, you will be prompted for a name and initial deposit amount for the Bank. This bank account info will then allow the
agent to register with Auction Central, resulting in the delivery of a connection to auction houses. All of this happens automatically. At
this point the user will be prompted to choose an auction house, then given the option to bid on an auction. Following the bid, a hold for the amount is placed on the agent's bank account. When an agent is out bid, this block is removed. The bidding, timing, and funds part 
of this process can be observed through the component's respective stdouts. At this point the agent(user) can choose to bid on another 
auction or exit. After 30 seconds of no bids being placed, an auction will finish, resulting in the funds required for the auction being withdrawn from the winner's account.

## Integration Test
The integration test allows for an easy way to test component functionality, with the draw back that there are no longer separate processes for each component, just separate threads, it is not used in the provided jars.

## Refer to the individual component READMEs for more detailed information.
